| September 3 |  8:30-9pm  |                                                                                    Thinking about how to approach this, I started by writing some pseudocode type things and I think it makes most sense to be recursive? I'm going to keep writing out how I think it could work and hopefully that will help me get a better idea of how to approach things. 5 mins later update: I think this is a good time to use BFS?? |
| September 3 | 9- 9:30pm  | Added  more pseudocode,  I'm getting stuck on where to put each recursive call and where to put base cases and such. Still need to remember how to do BFS with queues (I'm thinking thats the best way to organize which cells to go to next?) otherwise I have an idea about making a 2d array, maybe make a new object for each space with values like position, snake, ladder etc? I'm worried i'm overcomplicating this. |

| September 7 | 12-12:30pm |                                                                                       Looked more at the out of bounds error, looks like I'm getting to the correct number of rolls, but its not returning at the correct time, and then trying to loop through nodes that don't exist. still not really sure how to fix that, I think i should be de-incrementing the numRolls variable somewhere, but idk where to do that |
| September 9 |  10-10:30  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                figured out the issue with how to track rolls, then had to figure out where to set the number of rolls for each one. got another error, but it was because I was setting currentNode as visited, not nextNode |
