| September 3 | 8:30-9pm  |                                                                                    Thinking about how to approach this, I started by writing some pseudeocode type things and I think it makes most sense to be recursive? I'm going to keep writing out how I think it could work and hopefully that will help me get a better idea of how to approach things. 5 mins later update: I think this is a good time to use BFS?? |
| September 3 | 9- 9:30pm |  Added  more pseudocode,  I'm getting stuck on where to put each recursive call and where to put base cases and such. Still need to remember how to do BFS with queues (I'm thinking thats the best way to organize which cells to go to next?) otherwise I have an idea about making a 2d array, maybe make a new object for each space with values like position, snake, ladder etc? I'm worried i'm overcomplicating this. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
